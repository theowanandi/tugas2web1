		</p>
		<p>Knowing what a muscle does is critical to training it correctly - with that in mind let's take a look at the anatomy of the back:</p>

		<p><font size="4"<font color="yellow">TRAPEZIUS</font></font><br>
		</p>
		<p>This is a very wide triangular shaped muscle that covers almost all of the muscles at the nape of the neck and a large part of the back. It originates in the occipital bone at the base of the skull and is inserted in the scapula and clavicle. The fibers of this muscle provide pull in three directions: up, down and in. Its function is to turn the head and raise the shoulders.</p>

		<p><font size="4"<font color="yellow">RHOMBOIDEUS MAJOR/RHOMBOIDEUS MINOR</font></font><br>
		</p>
		<p>The rhomboids originate on the spinal column and attach to the middle of the scapula. Their function is to bring the scapula in towards the spine, literally meaning to squeeze the shoulder blades together.</p>

		<p><font size="4"<font color="yellow">TERES MAJOR</font></font><br>
		</p>
		<p>This muscle originates on the outer edge of the scapula and attaches to the humerus. It serves to pull the arm back.</p>

		<p><font size="4"<font color="yellow">LATISSIMUS DORSI</font></font><br>
		</p>
		<p>This is the largest muscle of the back. Fan or "V" shaped, they provide force in a number of body positions, these same positions can be duplicated on a pulldown machine using varying angles, that is, you can pull straight down, or in any leaning back position.

		They are attached to the upper end of the humerus and run down the vertebral column and pelvic girdle. The function of this muscle is to pull the arm downward. If the arm is in a fixed position, then the lats can pull the arm upward.</p>

		<p><font size="4"<font color="yellow">ERECTOR SPINAE</font></font><br>
		</p>
		<p>A group of muscles that give support to the spinal column. These muscles are: the longissimus, the spinalis and the iliocostalis. The function is to extend the spine.

		As you can see, the back is quite complicated. Yet, there are two main types of movements that work the back: pulldown movements and rowing movements. Then there are power moves, like the deadlift, snatch and power clean. These moves are more of a whole body exercise; they work much more than the back.

		I've always been a big believer in including at least one of these in your routine, not only because of all the muscles they work, but also because of the fact they cause a dramatic increase in the body's natural production of anabolic hormones such as testosterone and growth hormone.</p>

		<p><font size="4"<font color="yellow">THE SPLIT</font></font><br>
		</p>
		<p>While it's common to put chest and back together on the same training day - Arnold used to do this - it makes more sense to work back on it's own day, followed by biceps and forearms. This allows you to focus all of your energy on back training only instead of "sharing" energy with another big muscle group like the chest.</p>
