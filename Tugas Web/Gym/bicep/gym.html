		<p>The exercise of choice to build your biceps is called the curl, but there are many variations that hit the three major components of the biceps muscle group: the long head, the short head, and the brachialis. It's not just the actual movements that make these five biceps routines unique. By manipulating volume and rep targets, and adding post-failure techniques, you can take a beginner's workout and make it a major-mass builder, or even increase the speed of your workout for a leaning-out phase.

		What's worth remembering: When your elbows are in front of the plane of your body (as when doing preacher curls), the biceps long head isn't able to fully stretch, so these kinds of exercises better target the short head. Also, when your arms are behind the plane of your body (as when doing incline-bench curls), the long head is fully stretched so it picks up the greater load. Even moving your hands in and out when doing barbell curls changes the emphasis, so it's worth exploring the many variations here.

		You'll also want to try exercises that shift the position of your palmsâ€”whether supinated (palms up), pronated (palms down), or neutral (palms facing in). These subtle shifts make a decided difference in what area of your upper arm is engaged to the fullest.

		One more thing: You don't have to be a guy to get the most out of these workouts. We know guys really want big arms, so these workouts are definitely geared toward getting you jacked, no matter your level of experience, but I encourage women to try them on for size as well!</p>
