		<h1>Legs Workout</h1>
		<p><font size="6"<font color="green">LEG DAY</font></font><br>
		</p>
		<p>The very phrase conjures up images of nausea, days of hobbling, and legs that feel like jello. The feelings may be universal, but bodybuilders looking to annihilate legs have countless workout options at their disposal. While most workouts start with some variation of the squat—widely acclaimed as the best lower-body movement—exercise choice, foot position, and advanced training techniques all allow you to emphasize one particular area of the legs over others. That's great if you want to thicken up your quads, fill out your glutes, or beef up your hamstrings because of a weakness—or simply because you want to prioritize an area for a length of time.

		Each of the seven leg workouts below has a different focus. Find one that suits your needs for the next 4-8 weeks before switching to another specialized program. Or simply follow a solid overall mass-building plan like the one listed under Goal 1.

		While we can provide any number of formulas for advanced leg growth, you're still on your own when it comes to generating the intensity to survive a high-octane workout and withstanding the pain. Nail those last two factors and you'll leave your wheels no choice but to grow.</p>
